Different problems in statistics and probability:

Problem 1: a_combination_problem (probability calculation problem)

Problem Statement:
Anita randomly picks 4 cards from a deck of 52-cards and places them back into the deck (Any set of 4 cards is equally likely). Then, Babita randomly chooses 8 cards out of the same deck (Any set of 8 cards is equally likely). Assume that the choice of 4 cards by Anita and the choice of 8 cards by Babita are independent. What is the probability that all 4 cards chosen by Anita are in the set of 8 cards chosen by Babita?

Solutions:
Two solution methods are suggested: (i) Monte Carlo simulation, and (ii) Exact method (See the Python notebook a_combination_problem.ipynb for the solution)
